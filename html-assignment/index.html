            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jairon Favell, I'm from Kenora, Ontario, which is a small town 19 hours away from here. I
                enjoy
                playing sports, gaming, music, and hanging with friends. I chose <abbr
                    title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> because you come out of the program with multiple skills
                from photography to graphic design to coding. I'm also not very good with hands on stuff and have always
                liked computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coding is a skill I've always wanted to pick up, but never knew how to start. My older brother also
                codes which is why I've always been so interested in it. He knows over 10 programming languages and
                never
                thought to teach me one... <em>classic older brother move</em>. My goal is to learn at least 3
                programming
                languages just to
                say I can.
            </p>
